## Learning Objectives
* I want to gain a firm understanding of Database architecture and design.
* I want to begin to make TDD my default mode of development, rather than writing code first and fixing it later.
* I want to improve my front end development skills, particuarly CSS.

## Problem to Solve
* I buy loads of games.
* I love cataloguing things and I love stats and metrics.
* I want to be able to keep a track of and measure things about my games collection.    
* I want to be able to share this information with my friends.

## What I am building
* I want to build a small scale social netowrk for video games.
* I want to connect gamers together and allow them to talk about games, look at what games their friends are playing and just hang out and chat.
* I want to connect to a nubmer of APIs. A video game database API would be good so that I do not need to keep track of every game ever.
* It would be great to be able to track when a friend is currently playing on gaming service X so that I can hop on and play. Currently, the various gaming services are in their own enclaves which makes it hard to keep a track across a number of services. A central point of contact for gamers would be awesome.
